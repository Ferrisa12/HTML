      <h3>Nitsch Engineering Writing and Layout Sample</h3>
       <p>I created this article for the Boston based firm Nitsch Engineering Inc. while pursuing a Marketing position with them. I wanted to highlight one of the company’s ongoing projects by focusing on Frick Park, its green initiative, and how important the park is to the people it serves. I combined my knowledge of Photoshop and InDesign to create an eye-catching background that used earth tones to suggest the environmental benefit Nitsch would bring to the park and surrounding lands.</p>

       <p>I wanted the copy to feature the history and future of the Environmental Center because that is what Nitsch Engineering Inc. is constructing. Highlighting the importance of the Center and the education it brings to local children was paramount. Nitsch sets the stage, whatever they create will reflect on Frick Park as a whole. Building a LEED certified structure shows the residents of Pittsburgh that the city cares about the environment and the children that spend their summers learning and exploring Frick Park.</p>

        <p>I am quite proud of what I created, I believe it shows my design and layout skills while presenting my professional copy writing education. It was quite enjoyable to brainstorm where to start and take this project then follow through to create a finished product.</p>

    <h3>Cookbook in Progress</h3>
      <p>Being a new cook and finding most of my meals on the internet, I wanted a way to keep everything that was a hit in one place. I decided the best way to get some InDesign practice in while keeping track of all my recipes was to create a cookbook! I started by collecting recipes I had liked and typing them up in my own words into Word. Next, I began working on the book cover, which probably is the last thing created in the publishing world but I wanted to be artistic. I finalized chapter groupings (Pasta, Snacks, Rice…) and started working on the recipe pages. I had to do some cookbook research to see what the professionals did and decided I liked the 2 column approach. Including pictures was important, because I know when I browse cookbooks if the recipe doesn’t have a picture I probably won’t try it.</p>

      <p>My cookbook is still a work in progress, I keep finding new dished I want to add and make my own. I keep dreaming one day someone will want to publish it and I will get my own show on Food Network!</p>

        <h3>Penguin Bookshop Letterhead</h3>
          <p>I was asked by the Penguin Bookshop’s manager to help create letterhead. I used my InDesign knowledge and eye for design to create several options to choose from.</p>

          <p>At first I was given almost complete creative freedom, but as I submitted samples it became clear the Penguin Bookshop wanted certain elements placed in specific locations. I was asked to keep the logo centered on the page, and this became the thorn in my side for a while. Centering the image was no problem, however, placing the words “Penguin Bookshop” on either side was tricky. Because the words are different lengths I went back and forth with pulling the words close to the center and having the margins different sizes or pushing the words to the sides and having unequal space next to the logo.</p>

          <p>As you can see, I decided to align the words to the margins. I felt it made the heading more noticeable and less cramped together. The Penguin Bookshop loved my letterhead and I plan on creating more designs for them in the future.</p>
