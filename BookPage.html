        <h4>Neil Gaiman</h4>
        <h4><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Gods-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0380789035" target="_blank"><em>American Gods</em></a></h4>
           <p>Shadow is released from prison only to find out his wife had been cheating on him and was killed in a car accident. On his way to the funeral, Shadow meets Mr. Wednesday and takes a job as his bodyguard. This leads Shadow into the other side of America, where the old gods are real and are making their last stand against the gods of today.</p>

            <p>Just a few of the gods to make appearances in the book are the Egyptian goddess Bast, Loki, Anansi from African folklore, and Czernbobg the Slavic god of darkness. In the world of <em>American Gods</em> if people believe in a god they become real. Basically, the gods are inside us. There are many incarnations of each god across the world, Anansi came to America from Africa with the slaves, and the Norse gods were “carried” in the minds of the Vikings and came to America when they first discover the continent. Because of this new gods are being born, Media, the Internet, and Money are all being created by modern people’s desires.</p>

            <p>The conflict of the book comes from the new gods wanting supremacy and to destroy the old gods. As the old gods lose followers they become more marginal and less powerful. Most of the gods encountered by Shadow seem like your eccentric neighbor, they live in apartment complexes and work day jobs. Thoth, the Ancient Egyptian god of knowledge runs a funeral parlor in Cairo, Illinois. Though Shadows travels with Mr. Wednesday, we see how gods live and become attached to them, they are more like our crazy aunt than all powerful deities. We want the old gods to win, they are the underdogs and have more personality than the gods of today.</p>

            <p>Overall, I love <em>American Gods</em> it is the first book I read by Neil Gaiman who has become my favorite author. I think the book brings up interesting ideas of what gods are and what is important in our lives today. It is fun to look up the characters and find out about new religions and beliefs from around the world.</p>

        <h4>Neil Stephenson</h4>
        <h4><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553380958" target="_blank"><em>Snow Crash</em></a></h4>
            <p>Cyberpunk is within the realm of science fiction and is primarily about living in a world with advanced technology but low living standards. Hiro Protagonist the hero and protagonist of the book is one of the creators of the Metaverse, a wildly popular virtual reality world, but even will his success he lives in a storage unit. Hiro discovers a pseudo-narcotic while in the Metaverse named “Snow Crash” that can affect users in the real world. This leads Hiro on a trail that takes him through ancient Sumerian culture, linguistics, and computer viruses that make the user sick.</p>

            <p>The language of <em>Snow Crash</em> is a mix of steam of consciousness and hacker speak. I have laughed out loud while reading this book and the first chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book. An interesting aspect of the book is that America has fallen to corporations and individual entrepreneurs. A Chinese food mogul and the Mafia own sovereign land which operates under its own laws. There is no unifying government anymore, each area is owned and operated differently from the next and requires proper documentation to move between the enclaves. It felt like reading a post-apocalyptic novel how everything was so broken and lawless. Our hero, Hiro, encounters citizens of a white supremacist enclave who legally try to murder him for being half Korean and half Black.</p>

            <p>The main focus of <em>Snow Crash</em> is how our brain stem is like a computers BIOS. We are programmed by language to act and think certain ways. The Snow Crash virus is a program that uses ancient Sumerian language to reprogram the human brain. The whole second half of the book breaks down Sumerian history and religion. A main idea brought up is that religion is a virus, it is an idea that clings to a person’s brain and is replicated throughout a population. Computers become a metaphor for human lives.</p>

          <p>This is another book I read about once a year, it’s a fun adventure that makes me think about culture, computers, and religion.</p>

        <h4>China Mieville</h4>
        <h4><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perdido-Street-Station-Crobuzon-Book-ebook/dp/B000FBFO8C" target="_blank"><em>Perdido Street Station</em></a></h4>
           <p>This novel takes place in a world similar but vastly different to our own, where humans exist alongside insect-like people, bird people, even humanoid cacti, and science and magic bleed together.  Isaac (our hero) is asked by a bird creature to help regain his ability for flight after his wings were violently cut off. While trying to help Yagharek (the bird man) a giant dream eating moth attacks the city leaving those affected braindead vegetables. Isaac becomes interwoven into the intrigue of where the moth came from and takes it upon himself to eradicate it after his girlfriend is kidnapped by the man who released it into the world. </p>

          <p>Overall, this was a great read with lots of science, magic, adventure, and mystery. China has an unusual writing style that takes some getting used to, but after the first chapter you hardly notice. I liked reading about all the different types of characters and wondering how they all evolved and came to be mostly bipedal humanoids that understand English. Could a world really exist in which sentient cacti coexist with a multi-dimensional giant spider being? </p>

          <p>One example of a race in <em>Perdido Street Station</em> are the Khepri. They are a type of insect person whose females look identical to human women with the exception of their heads, which resemble beetles. They cannot speak and instead  use sign language and pheromones to communicate. The male Khepri are like traditional insects; they have no human level intelligence and are mainly used to reproduce. How is it possible for two completely different species to evolve and look identical with one exception? There is never any mention throughout the book as to where the different races come from, be it space or greatly isolated land masses. </p>

          <p>China Mieville has written two other books that fit into a loose series with <em>Perdido Street Station</em>  each highlighting other races and exploring different regions. All of China’s books are very well written, descriptive, and look into the underworld of wherever the characters live. I would definitely give any of his books a chance.</p>
