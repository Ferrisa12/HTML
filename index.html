            <p style="font-size:18px">I would best describe myself as a hybrid between a <b>copywriter</b> and a <b>marketer</b>. Recognizing the heavy transition to digital materials (both in publishing in marketing), I have taught myself many skills and tools in <b>digital media creation</b> ranging from InDesign to HTML and CSS to build upon my education (<i>in fact: I built this website by hand in these languages!</i>). </p>

            <p style="font-size:18px">Currently, I am in the job market having recently moved to Boston (from the San Francisco Bay Area). I am extremely ambitious, quick to learn new technologies, comfortable in various environments (engineering and tech companies), and importantly: am interesting in taking on a role that would fit closely with the skills I described above. I strongly encourage you to look at my <a href="Resume.html">Resume</a> page, as well as my <a href="Projects.html">Projects</a> page to see a few samples of my writing and digital layouts.</p>

          <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
            <p>I love to be active! Whether it be running, biking, yoga, rock climbing, or just going for a walk I want to be outside moving around.</p>

            <p>In the past 4 years I have ran in several 5k&apos;s, completing each race in under 30 minutes. I also finished 9th in my age group in my first 10k, I have only ran one official half marathon and was so tired by the end of it I forgot to check my official time. Woops!  One day I hope to complete a marathon, but I need <em>way</em> more training for that.</p>

            <p>I would rather spend my vacation exploring than lying on a beach! Some of the adventures I have been on while traveling include climbing mountains in Arizona, hiking all over Northern California, camping in Idaho, scrambling over glacial deposits in New York, and meeting bison in Yellowstone. When I visited Hawaii in September I spent more days hiking and exploring than hanging at the beach. While there I climbed to the top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakal%C4%81" target="_blank"> Haleakala</a>, and visited the West Maui Forest Reserve. In Vancouver my friends and I climbed up 2,830 stairs to complete the <a href="https://www.grousemountain.com/grousegrind" target="_blank"> Grouse Grind</a> under the average time of an hour and a half.</p>

            <p>This Christmas I was given a hiking guide of Massachusetts, the guide points out the best locations for hikers of all levels. I hoped to get a lot of use out of the guide this winter, but the weather had other ideas. Now that the snow is <em>finally</em>  melting I am planning on hiking every weekend. I also have plans to hike some of the Appalachian Trail and take a long weekend to Acadia National Park in Maine. If it's outside, I want to do it!</p>

          <h3>Pacific to Atlantic</h3>
            <p> <p>Erie, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Boston oh my! I was born and grew up in Erie, PA and moved to a suburb of Pittsburgh in high school. I thought I hadn’t spent enough time in Pittsburgh to warrant going to a school somewhere else so I went to Duquesne University in downtown Pittsburgh. There I studied English Literature and PR &amp; Advertising and dreamed of moving to New York City or DC to work at a publishing company as an editor.</p>

            <p>After graduation, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with my significant other, where we were both offered jobs. It is such an amazing place, California is like a different country compared to Pennsylvania. Technology plays a huge role in the Bay Area, everyone I met worked for a tech startup and were creating an app on the side. It became clear to me that we are becoming a more technological society, this inspired me to take the initiative to learn programming languages and new software programs to become more marketable in a computer age. As much as I would have liked to stay in San Francisco, opportunity called and after 367 days we packed up and moved to Boston. </p>

            <p>The job market in Boston is friendlier towards those with Liberal Arts backgrounds and being closer to NYC, there are more publishing companies with branches in the area. Moving to Boston is the opportunity I need to break into the marketing or publishing industry. Despite the weather I have felt welcomed and at home in Massachusetts. It is such a historic state, exploring Salem and Plymouth is like going to a living museum! In the end being driving distance to my family is a great bonus and I didn’t even have to give up the ocean!</p>

         <h3>Grow Your Food</h3>
            
          <p>I <em>love</em> to cook and garden. Growing your own food and making something delicious out of it is so fulfilling (and filling). When I lived in San Francisco I had a small garden and grew kale, arugula, carrots, radishes, and sugar snap peas. The carrots and radishes didn’t do too well because the soil was too hard, but the peas were some of the best I had ever eaten. Now that I live on the third floor of an apartment building I am stuck growing plants in containers. </p> 
          <p>Since moving I have been recycling glass jars from jelly, salsa, and pasta sauce to be used as small planters. Carrots and radishes are probably out of the question, but I will grow myself a spice rack instead. By growing herbs I will be able to season most of my food from plants I grow myself. No more buying basil, mint, and sage from the grocery store, I can have it fresh whenever I need it! </p>
          <p>Cooking and baking are also hobbies of mine, I enjoy picking out a new recipe to try and making it my own. My mom was always cooking for my family so I never got a chance to make food for others until I moved out after college. Once I had a kitchen of my own, I couldn’t be stopped. I was making a new dinner or dessert every night. I have made donuts, bagels, stuffed grape leaves, stews, soups, burgers, pastas, and more! I want to keep challenging myself to find and execute more and more complex dishes. I hope one day I will be able to have Thanksgiving dinner at my house like my mom does now. Cooking for others is my main motivation, I want to give that I make to my friends so we can all enjoy a meal together. This motivation is probably why I tend to make too much food for just two people and end up with enough leftovers for a whole week. </p>
          <p>I never know what I’m going to make next, I just let inspiration strike!</p>
